Welcome to my Github! — 💻

My name is Luan Cabral and I was born on 11/22/01, this is why my username goes by @luanc22.

I was born and raised in São Paulo, Brazil, but in 2019 I got a scholarship to study Computer Science at the Federal Institute of Santa Catarina, so I moved to the state of Santa Catarina, where I am currently studying during the morning.

I got into computers and technology when I was about 8 years old because of my father (I love you dad) and since then, I've been thrilled to discover new things about this digital world, so I got into programming when I was about 15, started with Python until I got to College, where I learned mostly Java and a little of C.

Then, in 2022, I had the opportunity to join the class of the "Academia do Programador", a course to train developers and position them for the job market, where I am currently attending during the afternoon and learning C#.
